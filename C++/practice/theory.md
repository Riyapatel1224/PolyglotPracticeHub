**Class** : class is user defined datatype which contains data members and member function. 

    - Data Members: These are the variables that belong to a class. They can be of different types such as int, float, char etc., or they can even be other classes themselves. 
    - Member  functions are the functions associated with a particular object of a class.

Object : identity of class

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Constructor** : is a special functions that contains same name as class name ,(without void) cannot have return type. can have arguments. called automatically when object of class is created.

TYPES OF Constructor:
1. Defualt Constructor : A constructor which has no argument is known as default constructor.
2. Paramitarized Constructor : A constructor which has parameters is known as Paramitarized constructor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Destructore** : A destructor works opposite to constructor; it destructs the objects of classes. It can be defined only once in a class. Like constructors, it is invoked automatically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**This Pointer** : this is a keyword that refers to the current instance of the class. There can be 3 main usage of this keyword in C++.
-It can be used to pass current object as a parameter to another method.
-It can be used to refer current class instance variable.
-It can be used to declare indexers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Staic** : In C++, "static" means something that's shared among all objects of a class. When you mark a variable or a function as static inside a class, it means there's only one instance of that variable or function for all objects of that class. It's like having something common for all the objects, rather than each object having its own separate copy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**structure** : 'struct' is like a box where you can keep different types of things together, and you can easily access them whenever you need them. It's a simple way to organize your stuff!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**enumeration** : an enum is a way to give names to numbers. It makes it easier to work with specific options or choices in your code, just like picking characters in a game.
