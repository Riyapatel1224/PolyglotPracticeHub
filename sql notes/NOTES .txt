CHAPTER 2

ORDER BY
- ASCENDING ORDER : LOWEST TO HIGHEST
- DESCENDING ORDER : HIGHEST TO LOWEST
- ALPHABETS/CHARACTER ASCENDING : A TO Z , a TO z : A->65 , B -> 66 , Z-> 90 , a->97 , b-> 98 ... z =122
- ALPHABETS/CHARACTER DESCENDING : z TO a , Z TO A : A->65 , B -> 66 , Z-> 90 , a->97 , b-> 98 ... z =122

SELECT SYNTAX : SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... ORDER BY ... OFFSET ... FETCH ...;
BY DEFAULT ALL ROWS ARE DISPLAYED IN ASCENDING ORDER OF IT'S ROWID.
SELECT ROWID , EMPLOYEES.* FROM EMPLOYEES;

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES ORDER BY COMMISSION_PCT ASC NULLS FIRST;
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES ORDER BY COMMISSION_PCT DESC NULLS LAST;

Top n Analysis
1 TO DISPLAY ROWS FROM TOP OF THE TABLE
2 TO DISPLAY ROWS FROM BOTTOM OF THE TABLE
3 TO DISPLAY ROWS FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE

Syntax : SELECT * FROM table_name FETCH FIRST table_number_to_display ROWS ONLY;
	   SELECT * FROM table_name FETCH NEXT table_number_to_display ROWS ONLY;
FIRST AND NEXT HAS IDENTICAL MEANING AND FUNCTIONALITY.

Syntax: SELECT * FROM table_name OFFSET table_number_to_remove ROWS;
DEFAULT OFFSET VALUE IS 0

TO DISPLAY ROWS FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE (DISPLAY ROWS BETWEEN 5 AND 11) : OFFSET ... FETCH ...

Syntax : SELECT * FROM table_name OFFSET rows_to_remove ROWS FETCH FIRST/NEXT rows_to_display ROWS ONLY;

RESTRICTION/SELECTION : DISPLAYING SOME OF THE ROWS OF THE TABLE IN RESULT WHICH SATISFIED OUR CONDITIONS/REQUIREMENTS.
FOR RESTRICTION/SELECTION WE WILL USE 'WHERE' CLAUSE.

TYPES OF COMPARISON OPERATORS : 

1 SINGLE ROW/SCALAR 
SINGLE ROW/SCALAR : IT CAN COMPARE SINGLE VALUE WITHIN SINGLE CONDITION
LIST OF SINGLE ROW COMPARISON OPERATORS : = < > <= >=   <> != ^=
Eg: DISPLAY ALL WHO WERE HIRED AFTER YEAR 95
    SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE HIRE_DATE > '31-DEC-95' ORDER BY HIRE_DATE;
    
2 MULTI ROW
MULTI ROW : IT CAN COMPARE MULTIPLE VALUES WITHIN SINGLE CONDITION

3 SPECIAL
SPECIAL OPERATORS ARE USED FOR SPECIALLY DESIGNED CONDITIONS.
